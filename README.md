# Cat Tinder

Swipe through cat breeds because why not.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then press `i` for iOS, `a` for Android, or scan the QR code with the Expo Go app.

## What it does

Shows you different cat breeds in a Tinder-style card interface. Each card has info about the breed - where they're from, their temperament, and lifespan.

Built with React Native and Expo. Uses the Cat API for breed data.
